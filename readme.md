# Carberus

Carberus is a learning project.
It is built using the Spring Boot framework and is mimicked to be a simple and easy-to-use application for managing school-related data.

Through this project, I aim to learn and practice the following technologies:
- Java
- Spring Boot
- Spring Data JPA
- Spring Security
- Spring Test

In the future, I would like to add more features to this project, such as:
- Spring Cloud
- Spring Batch
